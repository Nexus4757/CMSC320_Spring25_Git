Answer: Because Git is a great and efficient way to store and share our code. It makes collaborating or exchanging code/data easier, faster and hassle-free which we need in this course

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: I believe that data science is useful in every field but if I had to pick one I think the healthcare industry has huge potential where data science can be applied. I believe this because they can use data science to analyze historical health records to find patterns/early symptoms for serious diseases that people can be prone to which helps in prevention rather than cure.
